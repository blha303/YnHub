I modified YnHub.exe to fix the MySQL support for userstats logging. The compiler changed the quotes to inverted commas,
and MySQL was chucking it out. Used a hex editor to change the inverted commas in the query strings back to apostrophes,
and it works now. The modified version is above, "YnHub - Fixed MySQL.exe".
